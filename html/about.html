                    <h4>Purpose: </h4>
                    <p>
                        This website is dedicated to the conservation and betterment of our environment. Our Earth is staring in the face of an acute crisis in terms of its ecological well-being. Overpopulation has resulted in overuse of resources, much more than what the Earth can replace in that amount of time. The significant depletion of resources has potential for a great crisis for human race in every sphere possible. The overuse may lead to short-term economic gains but in the long run, the very survival of human race is in question. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The biggest problem with this issue is that there is so little awareness that, it can lead to a lot of wasted precious time. Every little effort from each one of us can be extremely significant in the long run when we battle to survive. The ecological destruction is almost imminent and all we can do is to buy more time at the expense of short-term economic gains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, the main purpose of this website is to spread awareness about how different human activities are leading to a burning phenomenon of climate change that possesses the potential to wipe out life on the only planet, it is known to exist.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Objectives</h4>
                    <h5>The objectives of the site mainly revolve around (but are not restricted to):</h5>
                    <p>
                            Spreading awareness regarding the ecological and climatic imbalance experienced during the recent decades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Make people aware about the different methods they can use to overcome climate change and manage their waste generation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The biggest culprit of waste problem is plastic. Therefore, safe disposal of plastic and reducing its use to a bare minimum is something that needs to be prioritised. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid black; border-right:2px solid black;">
                            Finally, discussing the effects of climate change on different countries on basis of their socio-political and economic conditions and different socio groups in our country. From a bird’s eye view of the situation, it can be safely assumed that the poorer a particular group or person is, more are the chances that they’ll be affected by deteriorating climatic conditions (egs. Include farmers, people dependent on natural resources for their trade and profession, etc.).The mentioned groups are directly affected by the rapid depletion of resources and resort to greedy use of already limited pool, resulting in worsening the condition even further.
