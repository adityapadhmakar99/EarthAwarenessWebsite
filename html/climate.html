			<h2 class="top">Rising Sea Level</h2>
			<p>
				<h4>Thermal Expansion:</h4> When water heats up, it expands. About half of the past century's rise in sea level is attributable to warmer oceans simply occupying more space.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Melting Glaciers and Polar Ice Caps:</h4> Large ice formations, like glaciers and the polar ice caps, naturally melt back a bit each summer. In the winter, snows, primarily from evaporated seawater, are generally sufficient to balance out the melting. Recently, though, persistently higher temperatures caused by global warming have led to greater-than-average summer melting as well as diminished snowfall due to later winters and earlier springs. This imbalance results in a significant net gain in the ratio of runoff to ocean evaporation, causing sea levels to rise.
				</li><br/>

				<li class="bottom">
					<h4>Ice Loss from Greenland and West Antarctica:</h4> As with the glaciers and ice caps, increased heat is causing the massive ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica to melt at an accelerated pace. Scientists also believe meltwater from above and seawater from below is seeping beneath Greenland's and West Antarctica's ice sheets, effectively lubricating ice streams and causing them to move more quickly into the sea. Higher sea temperatures are causing the massive ice shelves that extend out from Antarctica to melt from below, weaken, and break off.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="top">Droughts</h2>
			<h4>What is a Drought?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					During dry and hot weather periods, it is common to find dry and cracked earth without even a single shed of water or wet areas. Lakes, rivers, and streams may as well run dry. Well, these are the typical earth conditions that define drought in layman terms
				</li>
				<li>
					Drought can simply be defined as extended periods of precipitation shortage, normally for a season or more resulting in water deficiency for some human activities or environmental sustainability. Human activities such as farming, irrigation, or domestic uses of water are normally highly impacted during droughts.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="../res/img/drought.gif" class="cl_img">
			<h4>What causes a drought?</h4>
			<p>
				Drought has many causes. It can be caused by not receiving rain or snow over a period of time. If you live in a place where most of the water you use comes from a river, a drought in your area can be caused by places upstream from you not receiving enough moisture. There would be less water in the river for you and other people who live along the river to use. People can also play a big role in drought. If we use too much water during times of normal rainfall, we might not have enough water when a drought happens.
			</p>
			<h4>How does a drought affect our lives?</h4>
			<p class="bottom">
				Drought affects our lives in many different ways because water is such an important part of so many of our activities. We need water to live, and animals and plants do too. We need water to grow the food we eat. We also use water for many different things in our lives, like washing dishes, cooking, bathing, and swimming or river rafting. Water is also used to help make the electricity we use to run the lights in our houses and the video games you may like to play. When we don’t have enough water for these activities because of a drought, many people and many different things will be affected in many different ways.

			<h2 class="top">Storms are Getting Stronger</h2>
			<p>
				What exactly does it mean for storms to get “stronger”? Does it mean faster winds? A larger wind field? Lower pressure at the center? More rain and snowfall? Higher storm surges?
			</p>
			<p>
				<blockquote class="quote">“You have to remember that storms aren’t one-dimensional,” says Del Genio. “There are many types of storms, and sorting out how aspects of each type respond to warming is where the science really gets interesting.”</blockquote>
			</p>

			<p>
				Rising sea levels exacerbated Sandy’s storm surge, for example, a direct link between global warming and storm damage. And abnormally high sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic probably intensified the storm. But pinning all of Sandy’s fury—its hybrid nature, the scale of its winds, its unusual track—on global warming is premature, says Shepherd, the current president of the American Meteorological Society
			</p>
			<p class="bottom">
				Weather forecasters use terms like snowstorms, derechos, hailstorms, rainstorms, blizzards, low-pressure systems, lightning storms, hurricanes, typhoons, nor‘easters, and twisters. Research meteorologists and climatologists have a simpler way of dividing up the world’s storms: thunderstorms, tropical cyclones, and extra-tropical cyclones. All are atmospheric disturbances that redistribute heat and produce some combination of clouds, precipitation, and wind.
			</p>
			<h2 class="top">Global Warming</h2>
			<p>
				<h4>Global warming</h4> which is also referred to as climate change, is the observed rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system  the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °C  in the lowest emissions scenario, and 2.6 to 4.8 °C in the highest emissions scenario .These readings have been recorded by the “national science academies of the major industrialized nations”. Future climate change and impacts will differ from region to region. Expected effects include increase in global temperatures, rising sea levels, changing precipitation, and expansion of deserts. 
			</p>
			<h4>Causes:</h4>
			<p>
				Global warming is a serious environmental issues. The causes are divided into two categories include "natural" and "human influences" of global warming.
			</p>
			<h4>Natural Causes of Global Warming:</h4>
			<ul class="bottom">
				<li>rotation of the sun that changes the intensity of sunlight and moving closer to the earth</li>
				<li>greenhouse gases</li>
				<li>Volcanic eruption</li>
